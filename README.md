# My First calculator in Python

This is my very first project written in Python: a simple calculator that supports basic arithmatic operations.

## Features
-Addution
-subtraction
-Multiplication
-Division('/') with zero-division check

What I Learned
-Taking user input in Python(input)
-Converting strings to numbers(float)
-Using conditional statements(if/elif/else)
-Handling errors like division by zero

This project is just the beginning of my Python journey.
I will continue to improve and add more features as I learn more!
